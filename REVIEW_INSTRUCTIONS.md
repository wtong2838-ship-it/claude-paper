## Project Overview

**Title:** "Investing in Intelligence: A Real Options Framework for AI Compute Infrastructure"

**Author:** Vincent Gregoire (HEC Montreal)

**Research question:** How should firms optimally invest in irreversible AI compute capacity under demand uncertainty, regime switching, strategic competition, and default risk — and what do observed investment decisions reveal about firms' private beliefs regarding transformative AI?

**Methodology:** The paper builds a unified real options model in several layers:

1. **Single-firm benchmark** (Phase 1): Analytical solution for optimal investment trigger and capacity with regime-switching demand and diminishing returns calibrated to AI scaling laws.
2. **Duopoly with default risk** (Phase 2): Extends the benchmark to two-firm competition with endogenous default boundaries and credit risk.
3. **N-firm sequential equilibrium** (Phase 3): Numerical backward-induction solution for N heterogeneous firms with dynamic training/inference allocation.
4. **Calibration** (Phase 4): Parameters calibrated to publicly available data on AI compute costs, scaling laws, and stylized firm characteristics.
5. **Revealed beliefs** (Phase 5): An inversion methodology that backs out firms' implied probability of transformative AI arrival from observable investment and market cap data.

**Target journals:** AER, JF, RFS, or Econometrica.

## Review Scope

Your review covers two areas, weighted roughly equally.

### Part 1: Code Validation

Verify that the implementation is correct, the tests are meaningful, and the code faithfully implements the mathematics described in the paper.

### Part 2: Paper Review

Evaluate the paper as a referee would for a top finance or economics journal (AER, Econometrica, JF, RFS).

## Detailed Review Checklist

Work through every section below. For each item, state whether it **passes**, **has issues** (describe them), or **could not be verified** (explain why). Be specific: cite file paths, line numbers, equation numbers, proposition numbers, and test names.

### 1. Mathematical Correctness

- [ ] **Propositions vs. code**: For each proposition in the paper (`_model.qmd`, `_extensions.qmd`, `_appendix.qmd`), locate the corresponding implementation in the source code. Verify that the formulas in code match the formulas in the paper exactly. Flag any discrepancies, even notational ones.
- [ ] **Proofs**: Read the proofs in `_appendix.qmd`. Check logical completeness — are all steps justified? Are boundary/edge cases handled?
- [ ] **Numerical methods**: In `models/nfirm.py` and `calibration/revealed_beliefs.py`, verify that numerical algorithms (root-finding, backward induction, fixed-point iteration) are correctly implemented. Check convergence criteria and tolerances.
- [ ] **Parameter consistency**: Verify that default parameter values in `models/parameters.py` match the calibration values stated in `_calibration.qmd`. Check units and scaling.
- [ ] **Regime switching**: Verify the regime-switching demand process implementation in `models/base_model.py` matches the specification in `_model.qmd`. Check transition intensities, drift, and volatility handling.

### 2. Code Quality and Testing

- [ ] **Test coverage**: Run `just test` (or `uv run pytest --cov`) and report coverage. Identify any untested functions or branches in the models.
- [ ] **Test meaningfulness**: Read through the 7 test files. Are the tests checking economically meaningful properties (e.g., option values are positive, triggers decrease with volatility, default boundary lies below investment trigger)? Or are they trivial/tautological?
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Are boundary conditions tested? (e.g., zero volatility, single firm in N-firm model, lambda = 0 or very large lambda)
- [ ] **Numerical stability**: Check for potential numerical issues: division by zero guards, overflow in exponentials, ill-conditioned matrices, convergence failures.
- [ ] **Code organization**: Is the code well-structured? Are responsibilities cleanly separated between modules? Any code smells or unnecessary complexity?
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: Can results be reproduced by running `just run-pipeline`? Are random seeds set where needed?

### 3. Paper Content Review

Review the paper as a referee for a top journal. Address each sub-item.

#### 3a. Structure and Argument

- [ ] **Motivation**: Is the introduction compelling? Does it clearly articulate why this problem matters and what gap the paper fills?
- [ ] **Literature positioning**: Does the paper adequately situate itself relative to the real options literature (Dixit & Pindyck, McDonald & Siegel), strategic investment games (Grenadier, Weeds), and AI economics literature? Are there important omissions?
- [ ] **Model building**: Does the progression from single-firm to duopoly to N-firm feel natural and well-motivated? Is each extension clearly justified?
- [ ] **Identification**: Is the revealed beliefs methodology convincingly identified? What assumptions drive the inversion, and are they clearly stated and reasonable?
- [ ] **Conclusion**: Does it summarize findings effectively without overclaiming?

#### 3b. Writing Quality

- [ ] **Clarity**: Is the writing clear and precise throughout? Flag any passages that are confusing, vague, or poorly worded.
- [ ] **Notation**: Is mathematical notation consistent throughout the paper? Are all symbols defined before use?
- [ ] **Length and focus**: Is the paper appropriately scoped for a top journal? Any sections that feel padded or underdeveloped?
- [ ] **Abstract**: Does the abstract concisely convey the contribution, methodology, and key results?

#### 3c. Journal Fit

- [ ] **Contribution significance**: Is the contribution substantial enough for JF, RFS, or Econometrica?
- [ ] **Methodological rigor**: Does the paper meet the technical standards of these journals?
- [ ] **Formatting and conventions**: Does the paper follow the conventions of its target journals (Econometrica style, appropriate formality)?
- [ ] **Which journal fits best**: Based on the paper's strengths, recommend the most appropriate target journal and explain why.

### 4. Figures

- [ ] **Paper figures**: Review all 11 figures in `paper/figures/`, generated by `paper/generate_figures.py` (which delegates all computation to `src/ai_lab_investment/figures/paper.py`). For each figure, verify: (a) it accurately represents the underlying model output, (b) axes labels and legends are correct, (c) it is publication-quality (fonts, resolution, layout). List any issues.
- [ ] **Code-figure consistency**: Spot-check at least 3 figures by tracing the data from model code through `figures/paper.py` to the final plot. Verify the pipeline is correct.

### 5. Calibration and Results

- [ ] **Parameter values**: Are calibrated parameter values reasonable and well-sourced? Check against the references cited in `_calibration.qmd`.
- [ ] **Sensitivity**: Does the paper adequately explore sensitivity to key parameters (volatility, arrival rate, number of firms, cost of capital)?
- [ ] **Comparative statics**: Verify that reported comparative statics (how triggers/values change with parameters) are consistent with economic intuition and the model's predictions.
- [ ] **Revealed beliefs results**: Are the implied belief estimates for stylized firms plausible? Do they pass a basic sanity check?
- [ ] **Growth decomposition**: Is the decomposition of firm value into installed capacity value and growth option value correctly computed and reported?

### Report Location

Save your report to the `reports/` directory at the repository root with the filename:

```
reports/review_report_[YOUR_IDENTIFIER].md
```

Replace `[YOUR_IDENTIFIER]` with a short, unique identifier for yourself (e.g., `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`). Use lowercase with underscores.

**Before writing your report**, list files in `reports/` to check existing filenames and avoid overwriting another reviewer's report. Do NOT read the contents of any existing reports — only check filenames to avoid collisions.

### Important Constraints

- **Do not read other reports.** You must form your own independent assessment. Only list filenames in `reports/` to avoid naming collisions.
- **Be specific.** Cite file paths, line numbers, equation numbers, proposition numbers, and test names. Vague criticism is not useful.
- **Be constructive.** For every issue identified, suggest a concrete fix or improvement where possible.
- **Be honest.** If something is beyond your ability to verify (e.g., you cannot run the code), say so explicitly rather than guessing.
